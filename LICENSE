GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
                       Version 3, 29 June 2007

Copyright (C) 2025 Gabriel A. Matos

 Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
 of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.

                            Preamble

  The GNU General Public License is a free, copyleft license for
software and other kinds of works.

  The licenses for most software and other practical works are designed
to take away your freedom to share and change the works. By contrast,
the GNU General Public License is intended to guarantee your freedom
to share and change all versions of a programâ€”to make sure it remains
free software for all its users. We, the Free Software Foundation, use
the GNU General Public License for most of our software; it applies also
to any other work released this way by its authors. You can apply it to
your programs, too.

  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not price.
Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you have the
freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for them if you
wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you want it, that
you can change the software or use pieces of it in new free programs,
and that you know you can do these things.

  To protect your rights, we need to prevent others from denying you
these rights or asking you to surrender the rights. Therefore, you have
certain responsibilities if you distribute copies of the software, or if
you modify it: responsibilities to respect the freedom of others.

  For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether
gratis or for a fee, you must pass on to the recipients the same
freedoms that you received. You must make sure that they, too, receive
or can get the source code. And you must show them these terms so they
know their rights.

  Developers that use the GNU GPL protect your rights with two steps:
(1) assert copyright on the software, and (2) offer you this License
giving you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify it.

  For the developers' and authors' protection, the GPL clearly explains
that there is no warranty for this free software. For both users' and
authors' sake, the GPL requires that modified versions be marked as
changed, so that their problems will not be attributed erroneously to
authors of previous versions.

  Some devices are designed to deny users access to install or run
modified versions of the software inside them, although the manufacturer
can do so. This is fundamentally incompatible with the aim of protecting
users' freedom to change the software. The systematic pattern of such
abuse occurs in the area of products for individuals to use, which is
precisely where it is most unacceptable. Therefore, we have designed this
version of the GPL to prohibit the practice for those products. If such
problems arise substantially in other domains, we stand ready to extend
this provision to those domains in future versions of the GPL, as needed
to protect the freedom of users.

  Finally, every program is threatened constantly by software patents.
States should not allow patents to restrict development and use of
software on general-purpose computers, but in those that do, we wish to
avoid the special danger that patents applied to a free program could
make it effectively proprietary. To prevent this, the GPL assures that
patents cannot be used to render the program non-free.

  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
modification follow.

                       TERMS AND CONDITIONS

  0. Definitions.

     "This License" refers to version 3 of the GNU General Public License.

     "Copyright" also means copyright-like laws that apply to other kinds
     of works, such as semiconductor mask designs.

     "The Program" refers to any copyrightable work licensed under this
     License. Each licensee is addressed as "you". "Licensees" and
     "recipients" may be individuals or organizations.

     To "propagate" a work means to do anything with it that, without
     permission, would infringe one of the exclusive rights of the
     copyright holder. Propagation includes copying, distribution (with
     or without modification), making available to the public, and in some
     countries other activities as well.

     To "modify" a work means to copy from or adapt it in a way requiring
     permission under the copyright laws of the country. The resulting
     work is called a "modified version" of the earlier work or a work
     "based on" the earlier work.

     A "covered work" means either the unmodified Program or a modified
     version, in each case including portions that are under copyright
     protection.

     To "convey" a work means any kind of propagation that enables other
     parties to make or receive copies. Mere interaction with a user
     through a computer network, with no transfer of a copy, is not
     conveying.

     An interactive user interface displays "Appropriate Legal Notices"
     to the extent that it includes a convenient and prominently visible
     feature that (1) displays an appropriate copyright notice, and (2)
     tells the user that there is no warranty for the work (except to
     the extent that warranties are provided), that licensees may
     convey the work under this License, and how to view a copy of this
     License. If the interface presents a list of user commands or
     options, such a feature may be considered included if the list
     includes an item named "About", "Legal", or similar, which, when
     selected, displays the appropriate information.

  1. Source Code.

     The "source code" for a work means the preferred form of the work
     for making modifications to it. "Object code" means any non-source
     form of a work.

     A "Standard Interface" means an interface that (a) is widely used
     among developers working in the same field, and (b) is thoroughly
     documented, and (c) has no major subcomponents that are not
     generally available.

     The "Corresponding Source" for a work in object code form means all
     the source code needed to generate, install, and (for an executable
     work) run the object code and to modify the work, including scripts
     to control those activities. However, it does not include the
     source code for standard libraries or general-purpose tools that
     are not modified by the work.

     The Corresponding Source need not include anything that users can
     regenerate automatically from other parts of the Corresponding Source.

  2. Basic Permissions.

     You may use the Program for any purpose, without any fee or royalty.
     You may copy and distribute the Program in object code or source code
     form, with or without modifications, provided that you meet the
     following conditions:

     a) You must give any other recipients of the Program a copy of this
     License along with the Program. You may not impose any further
     restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.

     b) You must keep intact all copyright notices for the Program and
     any notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any
     warranty; and you must keep intact a copy of this License along with
     the Program.

     c) If you modify the Program and distribute it, you must cause the
     modified files to carry prominent notices stating that you changed
     the files and the date of any change.

     d) If you distribute the Program in object code or executable form,
     you must provide access to the Corresponding Source. You must either
     include a copy of the Corresponding Source with the Program, or
     provide a written offer, valid for at least three years, to give any
     third party, for a charge no more than your cost of physically
     performing source distribution, a copy of the Corresponding Source.

  3. Protecting Users' Legal Rights From Anti-Circumvention Law.

     No covered work shall be deemed part of an effective technological
     protection measure under any applicable law fulfilling obligations
     under Article 11 of the WIPO Copyright Treaty, and no covered work
     shall be used to effect, or to enable others to effect, an infringement
     of copyright under any applicable law fulfilling obligations under
     that Article.

  4. Conveying Verbatim Copies.

     You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's source
     code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously
     and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright
     notice; keep intact all notices stating that this License applies to
     the code; keep intact all notices that refer to this License and to
     the absence of any warranty; and give any other recipients of the
     Program a copy of this License along with the Program.

  5. Conveying Modified Source Versions.

     You may copy and distribute a modified version of the Program in
     source code form, provided that you meet all of the following
     conditions:

     a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices
     stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.

     b) You must keep intact all copyright notices for the Program and
     any notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any
     warranty; and you must keep intact a copy of this License along with
     the Program.

     c) You must provide access to the Corresponding Source. You must either
     include a copy of the Corresponding Source with the Program, or provide
     a written offer, valid for at least three years, to give any third party,
     for a charge no more than your cost of physically performing source
     distribution, a copy of the Corresponding Source.

  6. Conveying Non-Source Forms.

     You may convey a work in object code or executable form under the
     terms of sections 4 and 5, provided that you meet all of the following
     conditions:

     a) You must provide access to the Corresponding Source in a way
     that is consistent with section 6b.

     b) You must accompany the work with the complete Corresponding Source,
     or with a written offer, valid for at least three years, to provide
     anyone who possesses the object code either (i) a copy of the
     Corresponding Source, or (ii) information on where the
     Corresponding Source is publicly available.

  7. Additional Terms.

     Additional terms may be added by the copyright holder as described in
     the full GPLv3 text. You can keep these as long as they don't conflict
     with the main terms of this license.

  8. Termination.

     You may not propagate or modify a covered work except as provided
     under this License. Any attempt otherwise is void and will terminate
     your rights under this License.

  9. Acceptance Not Required for Having Copies.

     You are not required to accept this License in order to receive or
     run a copy of the Program. Ancillary propagation of a covered work
     does not require acceptance.

  10. Automatic Licensing of Downstream Recipients.

     Each time you convey a covered work, the recipient automatically
     receives a license from the original licensors to run, modify and
     propagate that work subject to this License.

  11. Disclaimer of Warranty.

     THE PROGRAM IS PROVIDED "AS IS", WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY OF ANY KIND,
     EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF
     MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND
     NONINFRINGEMENT.

  12. Limitation of Liability.

     IN NO EVENT SHALL THE COPYRIGHT HOLDER OR CONTRIBUTORS BE LIABLE
     FOR ANY CLAIM, DAMAGES OR OTHER LIABILITY, WHETHER IN AN ACTION OF
     CONTRACT, TORT OR OTHERWISE, ARISING FROM, OUT OF OR IN CONNECTION
     WITH THE PROGRAM OR THE USE OR OTHER DEALINGS IN THE PROGRAM.
